# Introduction

# Inflam
Inflam is a data management system written in Python that manages trial data used in clinical inflammation studies.

![Continuous Integration build in GitHub Actions](https://github.com/<nadinespy>/python-intermediate-inflammation/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main)

## Main features
Here are some key features of Inflam:

- Provide basic statistical analyses over clinical trial data
- Ability to work on trial data in Comma-Separated Value (CSV) format
- Generate plots of trial data
- Analytical functions and views can be easily extended based on its Model-View-Controller architecture

## Prerequisites
Inflam requires the following Python packages:

- [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/) - makes use of NumPy's statistical functions
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) - uses Matplotlib to generate statistical plots

The following optional packages are required to run Inflam's unit tests:

- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) - Inflam's unit tests are written using pytest
- [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/) - Adds test coverage stats to unit testing

## Installation
- Clone the repo ``git clone repo``
- Check everything runs by running ``python -m pytest`` in the root directory
- Hurray ðŸ˜Š

## Contributing
- Create an issue [here](https://github.com/Onoddil/python-intermediate-inflammation/issues)
  - What works, what doesn't? You tell me
  - Randomly edit some code and see if it improves things, then submit a [pull request](https://github.com/Onoddil/python-intermediate-inflammation/pulls)
  - Just yell at me while I edit the code, pair programmer style!

## Getting Help
- Nice try
